# My Personal Website - Assignment 3

This is my solution for Assignment 3 of the CS6.201 - Introduction to Software Systems course.

## Project Description

This website includes:

* A personal profile with information about myself, my education, and my skills.
* A JavaScript function to capture click events and page views.
* A text analysis tool that counts letters, words, spaces, newlines, special symbols, pronouns, prepositions, and indefinite articles in a given text input.

## Assumptions

* The user will input text with standard English spelling and grammar for the text analysis tool.
* The `cv.pdf` file is located in the `cv/` directory.
* Image files are located in the `img/` directory.

## How to Access

You can access the website via my GitHub Pages site: [your-github-username.github.io/your-repo-name]

## Browser Compatibility

Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (latest versions).

## LLM Usage

I used the Gemini to help structure and refine the code, particularly with the CSS styling and JavaScript logic for text analysis. I wrote the core logic and content myself.
